I focused on skin cancer classification using machine learning and AI, addressing a critical healthcare challenge in Australia. Identifying this problem was vital because I believe in finding solutions that can genuinely make a difference in people's lives. 

I developed a machine learning model to classify skin cancer types by integrating diverse datasets from publicly available skin cancer image repositories and medical databases to train the models. Using Orange data mining software, for its user-friendly interface and ability to compare several machine learning algorithms in one place, I evaluated the performance of four machine learning models including Neural Networks, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The Neural Network model achieved the highest accuracy at 84.9%.

This project highlighted the potential for machine learning in skin cancer diagnosis, offering a tool to assist early detection, and reduce waiting times for visual diagnosis

My work involved extensive data pre-processing, and rigorous model evaluation to arrive data-driven insights and recommendations. This demonstrates my ability in leveraging data analytics techniques to drive meaningful, evidence-based healthcare solutions.

By addressing this pressing health issue in Australia, my project contributes to innovative solutions that enhance diagnostic accuracy and accessibility, particularly in rural and regional areas with limited specialist care.
